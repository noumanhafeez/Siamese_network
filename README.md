### Project Title: Siamese Network for Image Similarity

### Project Goal: The goal of this project is to build a Siamese network that can be used to determine the similarity between two images.

### Project Overview: A Siamese network is a type of neural network that consists of two or more identical subnetworks. These subnetworks are trained to learn the same features from the input data. The similarity between two images is then determined by comparing the features extracted by the two subnetworks.

### Project Methodology: The Siamese network in this project will be implemented using the PyTorch deep learning library. The input data will be a set of image pairs, where each pair consists of two images of the same object. The images will be pre-processed to remove noise and resize them to a standard size. The Siamese network will then be trained on this dataset using a contrastive loss function.

### Project Evaluation: The performance of the Siamese network will be evaluated using a held-out test set of image pairs. The accuracy of the network will be calculated by determining the percentage of image pairs that are correctly classified as either similar or dissimilar.
